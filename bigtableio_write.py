"""BigTable connector

This module implements writing to BigTable tables.
The default mode is to set row data to write to BigTable tables.
The syntax supported is described here:
https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/quickstart-cbt

BigTable connector can be used as main outputs. A main output
(common case) is expected to be massive and will be split into
manageable chunks and processed in parallel. In the example below
we created a list of rows then passed to the GeneratedDirectRows
DoFn to set the Cells and then we call the BigTableWriteFn to insert
those generated rows in the table.

  main_table = (p
       | 'Generate Direct Rows' >> GenerateDirectRows(number)
       | 'Write to BT' >> beam.ParDo(BigTableWriteFn(config)))
